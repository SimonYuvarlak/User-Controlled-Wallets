# Create Wallet

Welcome to the last part of creating a wallet.

So far, you have developed this project to create a user-controlled wallet as a developer.

Now, you will play the role of the end user.
You will create a pin code and a recovery method for your wallet.
Only after doing that the wallet is ready to use.

- To complete the wallet creation, in the homework repo, click on the wallet icon in the middle of the homepage.
  You will find the necessary instruction there.

## Overview Of The Wallet Creation

Let's review what you have done so far to create a user controlled wallet.
We will split it to 2 part, firstly the part of the developer and secondly the part of the user.

### Part Of The Developer

Developer needs to get the following information:

- `App ID`
- `User ID`
- `User Token`
- `Encryption Key`
- `Challange ID`

After you as a developer, retrieved all the necessary information through api calls, now it is time for some user action.

### Part Of The User

User needs to do the followings:

- `Create a pin code`
- `Create a recovery code`

Well, it seems unfair a little since the developer most of the job, but that is where the beauty of using `Circle` lies. We hide the complexity from the user so that the user can use your dapp like an app.

Now, go ahead and finish the completion of a user controlled wallet because in the next lesson, you will be working with this wallet.
