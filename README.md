# User Controlled Wallets

- This is the first repo of the tutorial on how to use Circle API. 
- There will be several more repositories. 
- Each repo is connected to the one before.
- This is the main branch, includes the final code.
- You should switch to the study branch first where some parts of the code are missing.
- This tutorial is based on you working on the study repo but you can also just follow the main repo if you do not want to work with the code.

- Next tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/SimonYuvarlak/Working-With-User-Controlled-Wallets.git)
